# Spend-Stack-Public
Spend Stack's last version from [Jordan Morgan](https://www.twitter.com/jordanmorgan10), version 1.3.4. This is released under the M.I.T. license.

## Here are some important things to know:

1. I have to assume all liabilities with it as part of the agreement. So, you know, don't do something terrible.
2. You **can** ship an app based on this code, you **cannot name it Spend Stack**. This means you would need to change all references to the name "Spend Stack" within the source code as part of your adaption.
3. However, if you do ship an app based on this you **must include** the following somewhere in the app and **link to this post: https://www.swiftjectivec.com/spend-stack-is-open-source/**:

"This app is based upon Spend Stack's open source code."

And finally, while not a requirement, I'd love it if you told me about any app you ship based off of this code so that I can link it here to share the word.
